# str8ts-solver
A simple solver for the [Str8ts puzzle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Str8ts). It only works for 9x9 board size.

It uses backtracking without any optimizations, there are no strategies implemented. Just enter the numbers and press the solve button, it will find a solution if there is one. Usually it takes a few seconds for normal puzzles, but the more complex it gets, the slower the program works.

It's a small hobby project that I may improve sometime in the future, but don't expect too much.
